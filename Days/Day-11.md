#### Learned:

1. From Article 1:
      - So if your friend's account is logged into your system/mobile if he forgets to log out or you have the access to his account from their phone/system. you can change the Email Id and Mobile number from their account.
      - since Meta is not asking for the confirmation password while changing the parameters like Email, mobile number, and also we can add 2FA after changing the Mail/mobile number. 
      - Meta is not asking for the Confirmation Password While Altering the Important parameters. They should ask for the password while changing their Email and Mobile Number for better security.

2. From Article 2:
    - In bug bounties, we have no guarantee that we will get paid, “Luck” plays a major role even if you work hard, so learn daily & improve your skills, get a professional job as a pentester & do bug bounty part-time or in your free time to avoid burnout.
    - Always remember health is more important, so have a frequent break, eat healthily, do meditation, and a good amount of sleep.
    - A bug bounty is not the only way to earn, so go and try different things like developing, trading, gaming, vlogging, etc… & do what you love without getting bored & frustrated.

3. From Article 3:
    - Got to Know About many tools.
    - Can't list them cause there are many good tools.
